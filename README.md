# Project 1 - Regression Task with California Housing Dataset
## Overview

This project is based on the dataset named as "California Housing Prices Dataset" from the StatLib repository. It is not the recent data but is definately a good choice to a novice. 

It is assumed in this project that the the basics of python and the mathematics involved in this project is already known to user. Also, the user is already familiar with the programs such as Anaconda, Jupyter notebook, VS Code, etc

The dataset is first downloaded and then subject to analysis which will help in selecting a train model for the Machine Learning Task. By following a step-by-step prococess the project is implemented and is distributed in the manner of tasks. Later, a particular Machine Learning model is selected with the highest accuracy to make predictions.
